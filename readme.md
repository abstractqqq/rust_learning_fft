# Polynomials

1. Polynomials<T>, polynomials over T, where T satisfies the Num trait.

3. Implemented Add, subtract, multiply, divide (long division) for polynomials. (Tested for T=f64)

4. It is built for fun, and eventually I will build a fft for multiplication for polynomials. 

5. I do not aim for the utmost speed, as this is more of a learning project.


## Learning Rust

0. Tring to implement FFT for polynomial multiplication (Or convolution)
2. FFT implementation for the polynomial struct (multiplication).
